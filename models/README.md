# Model Naming Convention

This document outlines the standardized naming convention for all trained model artifacts. A consistent naming scheme is crucial for tracking experiments, ensuring reproducibility, and automating model loading and evaluation.

## General Structure

All model files should follow this general structure, which mirrors the naming of the dataset it was trained on:

`<DataSource>_<DataName>_<DataDetails>_<ModelType>_<ModelDetails>.<extension>`

---

### Component Breakdown

1.  **`<DataSource>_<DataName>_<DataDetails>` (Required)**
    *   This entire prefix is copied directly from the name of the **processed data file** used for training (e.g., from the `data/02_processed/` or `data/03_augmented/` directories).
    *   This ensures a direct and unambiguous link between a model and its training data.
    *   **Example:** `SYNTH_polynomial_3d_vars-3_samples-10000_noise-1.00`

2.  **`<ModelType>` (Required)**
    *   An identifier for the model architecture.
    *   **Examples:**
        *   `ann`: For the `SimpleNN` artificial neural network.
        *   `pysr`: For models generated by PySR.
        *   `linear`: For a simple linear regression model.

3.  **`<ModelDetails>` (Optional but Recommended)**
    *   A series of key-value pairs, separated by underscores, providing metadata about the model's architecture and training.
    *   **Common Keys:**
        *   `layers`: Number of hidden layers (e.g., `layers-3`).
        *   `neurons`: A dash-separated list of neuron counts per hidden layer (e.g., `neurons-64-64-64`).
        *   `run`: The specific training run number for a given dataset (e.g., `run-1`).
        *   `seed`: The random seed used for the training run (e.g., `seed-42`).
        *   `status`: The state of the saved model (e.g., `status-best` for the model with the best validation score, `status-final` for the model at the last epoch).

4.  **`<extension>` (Required)**
    *   The file format for the saved model.
    *   **Examples:** `pt` (for PyTorch models), `pkl` (for scikit-learn or PySR models).

### Examples

*   **Baseline ANN Model:**
    *   A model trained on `data/02_processed/synthetic_data/input_noise/SYNTH_polynomial_3d_vars-3_samples-10000_inputnoise-true_noise-1.00.csv`.
    *   The saved model would be named:
        `SYNTH_polynomial_3d_vars-3_samples-10000_inputnoise-true_noise-1.00_ann_layers-3_neurons-64-64-64_run-1_seed-469_status-best.pt`
    *   It would be saved in the path:
        `models/01_baseline/synthetic_data/input_noise/`
