# Enabling Standard Neural Networks to Accurately Model Equations for Engineering Problems Using IML

This project aims to demonstrate how to use Interpretable Machine Learning (IML) to enable standard neural networks to accurately model equations for engineering problems.

## Python Version

python 3.11.9 (available at https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3119/)

## Utilities

### `src/utils.py`

This module contains utility functions for the project.

#### `get_short_model_name(dataset_name, model_details, seed)`

This function creates a shortened, standardized name for a model based on the dataset name, model architecture details, and the random seed used during training. This is useful for saving and identifying models.
